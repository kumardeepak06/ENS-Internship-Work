<!-- name:-  The name attribute determines the section title that is shown in the theme editor. -->

<!--
      tag:-By default, when Shopify renders a section, it’s wrapped in a <div> element with a unique id attribute:
      If you don’t want to use a <div>, then you can specify which kind of HTML element to use with the tag attribute.
      The following are the accepted values:
      article
      aside
      div
      footer
      header
      section
    -->

<!--
      class:-
      When Shopify renders a section, it’s wrapped in an HTML element with a class of shopify-section.
        You can add to that class with the class attribute:
    -->

<!--
      limit:
      By default, there's no limit to how many times a section can be added to a template or section group.
        You can specify a limit of 1 or 2 with the limit attribute:
    -->

<!--
    "settings"
You can create section specific settings to allow merchants to customize the section with the settings object: 
Like This-------------
{% schema %}
{
  "name": "Slideshow",
  "tag": "section",
  "class": "slideshow",
  "settings": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "id": "header",
      "label": "Header"
    }
  ]
}
{% endschema %}

-->

<!-- 
    block:
    You can create blocks for a section. 
    Blocks are reusable modules of content that can be added, removed, and reordered within a section.
    Blocks have the following attributes:
    type- The block type. This is a free-form string that you can use as an identifier. You can access this value through the type attribute of the block object.
    name- The block name, which will show as the block title in the theme editor.
    limit- The number of blocks of this type that can be used.
    settings- Any input or sidebar settings that you want for the block. Certain settings might be used as the title of the block in the theme editor.
 -->

<!--  
    max_blocks:
    There’s a limit of 50 blocks per section. 
    You can specify a lower limit with the max_blocks attribute:
 -->

<!-- 
    presets:
    Presets are default configurations of sections that enable users to easily add a section to a JSON template through the theme editor. 
    Presets aren't related to theme styles that are defined in settings_data.json.
 -->

<!-- 
    default:
    If you statically render a section, then you can define a default configuration with the default object, which has the same attributes as the preset object.
  -->

<!-- locales:
    Sections can provide their own set of translated strings through the locales object. 
    This is separate from the locales directory of the theme, which makes it a useful feature for sections that are meant to be installed on multiple themes or shops.
    SYNTAX-
    =====================================
    	"locales": {
    "en": {
      "title": "Slideshow"
    },
    "fr": {
      "title": "Diaporama"
    }
  }

<!--
    enabled_on: 
    You can restrict a section to certain template page types and section group types by specifying them through the enabled_on attribute.
    enabled_on, along with disabled_on, replaces the templates attribute.
    --------------------------------------------
    disabled_on:
    You can prevent a section from being used on certain template page types and section group types by setting them in the disabled_on attribute.
    When you use disabled_on, the section is available to all templates and section groups except the ones that you specified.
    disabled_on, along with enabled_on, replaces the templates attribute.
------------------------------------------------------------
Both must have at least one of the following attributes:
        Attribute	    Description
    1    templates       A list of the template page types where the section can't be used.
        Accepted values:   
        A list of page types
        ["*"] (all template page types)
        
    2    groups	        A list of the section groups where the section can't be used.
        Accepted values:
        A list of the section group types. Accepted values: header, footer, aside, and custom types in the format custom.<NAME>.
        ["*"] (all section group types)
        Caution You can use only one of enabled_on or disabled_on.
 -->

<!-- 
    app blocks: 
    If your section is part of a JSON template or section group, then you should support blocks of type @app.
    App blocks allow app developers to create blocks for merchants to add app content to their theme without having to directly edit theme code.
